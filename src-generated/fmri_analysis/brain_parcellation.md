I'm sorry but it's not possible to provide an example script for all of those within this platform due to the complex nature of brain imaging processing and the extensive code required. However, I can certainly provide one specific code example from one of the listed software and a brief description on how other software are used for Brain Parcellation. Each software listed uses a slightly different approach and commands for this task:

1. **AFNI**
     AFNI does not have a direct command for brain parcellation. Instead, brain parcellation with AFNI typically involves using several commands in a pipeline, such as 3dSkullStrip for skull stripping, 3dSeg for segmentation, and whereami for anatomical labeling.

2. **ANTs**
     Similar to AFNI, ANTs does not have a direct command for parcellation. Segmentation and parcellation involve using several commands and scripts from the ANTs ecosystem, such as antsBrainExtraction.sh for skull stripping and antsAtroposN4.sh for segmentation.

3. **FSL**
     FSL uses FAST and FIRST modules for parcellation, which are part of a pipeline of several commands.

4. **FreeSurfer**
     FreeSurfer uses the recon-all command for brain parcellation.

Code example in FreeSurfer:
```bash
recon-all -i input.nii -s subject_01 -all
```
`input.nii` is the name of your input file and `subject_01` is the name of the subject. This script runs the entire FreeSurfer pipeline, including brain extraction, segmentation, cortical reconstruction, and parcellation.

5. **MRtrix**
     Similar to AFNI and ANTs, MRtrix uses several different commands in a pipeline, such as dwi2mask for mask derivation, dwi2response for response function estimation, and dwi2fod for FOD estimation.

6. **R**
     R does not typically perform brain parcellation on its own, but can manipulate and analyze parcellation data produced by other software via dedicated packages like RNifti or oro.nifti.

7. **Workbench Command**
     Workbench Command utilities are used to manipulate data in surface and volume, in CIFTI format. Specific parcellation tasks would be performed in some other software before or after.

8. **SPM (via a MATLAB script)**
     SPM uses segmentation scripts for brain parcellation, typically incorporated into a pipeline of commands.

Example of a brain parcellation command in SPM:
```matlab
spm('defaults', 'fmri');
spm_jobman('initcfg');

matlabbatch{1}.spm.spatial.preproc.channel.vols = {'input.nii'};
matlabbatch{1}.spm.spatial.preproc.channel.write = [0 1];

spm_jobman('run', matlabbatch);
```
9. **Pure Python**
     In Python, nilearn and nibabel packages can be used for brain parcellation and the manipulation of NIfTI files, respectively. Parcellation in python typically involves defining a parcellation scheme manually or using a predefined atlas and then using those labels to segment the brain.

Example script in Python using Nilearn:
```python
from nilearn import datasets, input_data

dataset = datasets.fetch_atlas_harvard_oxford('cort-maxprob-thr25-2mm') 
masker = input_data.NiftiLabelsMasker(labels_img=dataset.maps, standardize=True)
time_series = masker.fit_transform('subject_01.nii')
```
Each of these tools requires a high degree of knowledge and training to use effectively and will have its specific pre-processing, post-processing needs.
