There is a large number of commonly used frameworks in brain imaging that overlap in functionality. This project aims to provide comparable examples of common operations in different frameworks. The goal is to make it easier for researchers to switch between and learn unfamiliar frameworks.

All of the examples were automatically generated with GPT-4. And the following prompt:

> You are a helpful assistant in brain imaging.

> Show a short minimal example script that does [operation] in each of [frameworks] with a heading for each of them. Do not include instructions about installing software or downloading data.
