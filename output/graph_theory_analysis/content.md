Due to the complexity and unique aspects of each software, developing a full script within the context here may not be entirely feasible. However, I will share some basic guidelines on how to use them for Graph Theory Analysis. Note that these examples require preprocessed brain imaging data and also assume you have the necessary packages, modules, and required data files.

1. **AFNI**:

Langouet, Franco et al. (2020) have written an excellent tutorial about using AFNI's 3dNetCorr and 3dTrackID for graph theory analysis: https://langouet.franco.wiki.afni.nimh.nih.gov/tutoguide

2. **ANTs**:

ANTs (or Advanced Normalization Tools) does not have built-in tools specifically for graph theory analysis. It is mainly used for processing images before this kind of analysis. Once preprocessed with ANTs, graph theory analysis could be conducted with Python or MATLAB.

3. **FSL**:

FSL's primary tools for graph theory analysis include FSLnets and dual regression. The tutorial here: https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fslcourse/lectures/practicals/fmri15/index.html provides a walkthrough of using these tools.

4. **FreeSurfer**:

Like ANTs, FreeSurfer is mainly used for preprocessing before moving onto graph theory analysis with a different tool. Here's an example of how to use it:

```bash
#Recon-all command preprocesses the brain:
recon-all -i $INPUT -s $OUTPUT -all
```

5. **MRtrix**:

As with ANTs and FreeSurfer, MRtrix primarily offers preprocessing tools. You might use `tck2connectome` to create a connectome for later graph theory analysis:

```bash
tck2connectome $TRACTS $NODES $OUTPUT
```

6. **Pure Python**:

Networkx is a pure Python package often used for graph theory analysis:

```python
import networkx as nx

# Create the graph
G = nx.Graph()

# Now let's add some nodes and edges to the graph
G.add_node("Node1")
G.add_nodes_from(["Node2", "Node3"]) 

G.add_edge("Node1", "Node2") 

# Now, we can analyze the graph:
print(nx.info(G)) 
print(nx.density(G)) 
print(nx.degree_histogram(G)) 
```

7. **SPM**:

Again, SPM (Statistical Parametric Mapping) itself does not conduct graph theory analyses. However, it can preprocess images for graph theory analysis with tools like the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/) or CONN toolbox (https://web.conn-toolbox.org/) in MATLAB.
