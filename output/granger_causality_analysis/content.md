For such a task, please note that Granger Causality is a type of time series analysis and may not be directly supported in all neuroscience software packages you listed, and it is usually performed on preprocessed fMRI data. Furthermore, Brain imaging tools like FreeSurfer, ANTs, MRtrix, AFNI, and FSL are primarily used for tasks such as registration, segmentation, statistical analysis, etc. Granger causality is commonly used in EEG/MEG analysis but can also be used in fMRI.

Commonly, in neuroscience, Granger causality analysis might be performed in MATLAB using toolboxes like SPM or FieldTrip, or in Python using tools like NiPy or statsmodels.

Example scripts for such an analysis are not straightforward and would require input data that precisely suits the function's needs. Example scripts for this type of analysis can be quite large and would usually need to input data, perform checks on data, calculate Granger causality, and then plot or output results. They would typically be a part of a larger processing pipeline.

Here are basic illustrations to use Granger causality with Python - a language platform that some of these software offer interfaces for:

**Python**

Using the Statsmodels package:

```python
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm  

data = np.random.rand(100, 2)  
maxlag = 10
result = sm.tsa.stattools.grangercausalitytests(data, maxlag, verbose=False)
```

Note that this short script loads random data and isn't useful outside of a test context. Adjust it according to your specific data and needs.

Also, remember that proper preprocessing of fMRI data is important before attempting Granger causality analysis. There are numerous guides available online for how to do this using the software you've listed.
